# Slightly Smarter Contracts
This repository contains Ethereum smart contracts with errors. These contracts are used as exercises for  [the training located here.](https://github.com/BostonCybernetics/slightly-smarter-contracts/wiki)


<!-- ## Learning Objectives
- Learn how to programmatically detect flaws in smart contracts
- Discover features of Manticore that enable programmatic analysis
- Find a bunch of bugs

## Progression
- [Symbolic Analysis](symbolic_analysis)
  - [Easy to Analyze](symbolic_analysis/easy)
  - [Hard to Analyze](symbolic_analysis/hard)
- [Integer Overflows](integer_overflow)
  - [High level](integer_overflow/high_level)
  - [Low level](integer_overflow/low_level)
- [Unchecked External Calls](unchecked_external_call)
  - [Contrived Example](unchecked_external_call/representitive_example)
  - [King of the Ether Throne](unchecked_external_call/KotET) -->
